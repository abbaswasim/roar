  Metal multi-threaded command buffer filling advice
In a multithreaded app, itâ€™s advisable to break your overall task into subtasks that can be encoded separately.
Create a command buffer for each chunk of work, then call the enqueue method on these command buffer objects to establish the order of execution.
Fill each buffer object (using multiple threads) and commit them.
The command queue automatically schedules and executes these command buffers as they become available.
